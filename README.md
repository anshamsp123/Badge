## 📌 Overview
Insurance documents are often lengthy, complex, and filled with legal terminology, making it difficult for customers to understand their coverage and claim eligibility.  
This project proposes an **AI-powered insurance claim advisory and decision support system** that automates claim analysis, provides transparent explanations, detects fraud, and recommends optimal insurance policies.

The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, **Agentic AI**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)** to make the insurance process **faster, transparent, and user-friendly** for both customers and insurance providers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional insurance claim processing suffers from:
Manual verification of policy clauses
Delayed claim decisions
Lack of transparency in rejection reasons
High chances of fraud
Poor user understanding of insurance policies

This results in customer frustration and operational inefficiency for insurance companies.

---

## 🧠 Proposed Solution
The system acts as an **AI insurance assistant** that:
Understands user queries in plain language
Reads and interprets insurance policy documents
Automatically checks claim eligibility
Provides clear explanations for decisions
Detects fraudulent or suspicious claims
Recommends alternative or better insurance policies
Assists users with document management and reminders
